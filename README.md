# MakeBetter

MakeBetter is a simple set of patterns for working with Make in nodey/frontend projects.

## Installation and Usage

You probably want to install make-better as a devDependency:

```
npm install make-better --save-dev
```

On installation, make-better will create a template Makefile in your project (for now it assumes a frontend project).
